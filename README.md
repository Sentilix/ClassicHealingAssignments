# ClassicHealingAssignments

## 1. What is Classic Healing Assignments?
Classic Healing Assignments (CHA) let you assign Healers in a raid to Tanks or Raid markers, and post the assignments in the Raid channel (or a healer channel if you like).


### 1.1. How do I use it?
Open the CHA user interface by left-clicking on the CHA minimap icon.

You can now create a new Template, and add wanted tank(s) plus healer(s).

See a Template as a Boss fight: one template for one boss.

For example:
Lucifron might require 3 tanks, so you'll make a template with 3 tanks, each having one healer assigned.

Ragnaros might only require one tank, but you also need Melee healers, so in this case you will add two tanks: one main tank, and one Custom tank you can name "Melee".

When your assignments are ready, you can right-click the minimap icon to post the assignments to Raid chat.


## 2. Version 2.x?
The original addon code did not work after patch 1.13.4 / 2.5.1, and required some heavy refactoring to make it work again.
Instead the addon has been rewritten almost from scratch. The UI is close to the original version, but in general there are added more love into maintaining existing templates: you can for example just move a player up/down (previous/next tank) instead of first removing and then adding.

Version 2.0 is still in early alpha release. It works in "single user mode" (which basically means it only announces instructions locally).
